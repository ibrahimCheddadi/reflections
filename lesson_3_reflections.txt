When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when you want to share your code, or when you want to use it on multiple machines

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

because the repository can be mdified by others ad you might want to merge with them
